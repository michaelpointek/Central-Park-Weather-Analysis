### Visual 1 - Annual Average Minimum and Maximum Temperatures
 - Using the drop down tab, the user can chose to view either the average minimum temperature graph or the average maximum temperature graph. Each graph shows the average minimum/maximum temperatures for each year over a 154 year period. 
 
### Visual 2 - Average Seasonal Weather Phenomena 
 - This visual shows seasonal data revolving around different weather phenomena. The user can select the check boxes on the right hand side to view the data for one, two, three, or all four seasons. They may then select from the list of weather phenomena they want to view on the plot (average precipitation, average snowfall, average minimum temp, average maximum temp). The graph then plots the data with each colored line representing the data for the weather phenomena of choice for the selected season(s).

### Visual 3 - Min/Max Temperature by Month: Interactive Popup
 - User selects a month from the dropdown menu and then inputs a year (1912-2023). A popup will then show the minimum and maximum temperature days for that month in that year. The visual allows the user to narrow down min/max temperature data to a specific month, providing a closer look at temperature extremes.
